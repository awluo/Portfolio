                    <h2>Overview</h2>
                    <p>My goal for this project was design an assistive device for myself which would help me in my
                        daily life. I decided to create a sleep alarm clock that senses whether or not I am up late at
                        night, by detecting light levels in the room. If I am up past a certain bed time, the alarm will
                        sound and remind me it’s time to get sleep. If the user is still not not
                        in bed within 5 minutes of the alarm, a second snooze alarm
                        will be set off. The first alarm can be stopped by pressing
                        a snooze button but not the second snooze alarm.

                        I started with brainstorming ideas and sketching how I wanted the alarm clock to function and

                        to integrate the added functionality of light detection. It was definitely helpful to begin with
                        a solid concept in mind for what I was building.

                        The first two pieces I focused on were the LCD Display and the real time clock as these were the
                        two fundamental components to a basic working clock. I was able to get the LCD to display the
                        time data, although the time had to be hard coded in.

                    I started early on the menu system to eliminate the hard coding issue and to help make alarm/general
                    software testing easier. For user input, I used a potentiometer for entering values along a range
                    and a push button to select options. The code for the menu system ended being one of most complex
                    aspects of this project due to all the different settings with various inputs and screen displays.

                    In place of the potentiometer and push button, I attempted to use a rotary encoder to make user
                    input easier with continuous rotation and added button functionality. However, I spent way too much
                    time trying to figure out the wiring and code to read inputs from the rotary encoder without much
                    progress. I eventually switched back to my original choice of a separate potentiometer and push
                    button since they were more familiar to me and already integrated into the menu code.

                        I measured each of the components to ensure that they would fit appropriately. I sketched the

                        to hold both the Arduino and the breadboard. <br><br>
                        The clock was modeled in Fusion 360 before being laser cut. This step was also very time
                        consuming especially since I had little prior experience working with Fusion. I wanted to add
                        finger joints to each side to make the box more structurally sound, but the process of
                        making rectangular cuts on each edge proved to be pretty tedious.

                    I decided to go with acrylic as my material of choice because I wanted the clock to have a clean,
                    sleek appearance. I chose blue acrylic because since this was a sleep device, I felt that blue was a
                    calming color and also associated with night time. Once the pieces were cut, I realized the box
                    might actually be too small to fit everything inside. It turned out to be a tight fit, so I had to
                    strategically position and cram together all the internal components. In then end, I was able to
                    successfully fit everything inside.

                            Overall, I am pretty happy with how my project turned out. It functions as intended, and the
                            design is similar to how I envisioned, although there is definitely still room for
                            improvement.
                            Reflecting on the challenges I faced, I’m glad I pushed myself to work with new components
                            and
                            software. It was certainly frustrating at times, but these setbacks proved to be good
                            learning
                            opportunities.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            Moving forward, I know to more carefully consider which components I will need and to not
                            make
                            major changes prior to writing a lot of code. The menu code itself was more complicated than
                            anticipated, and it would have been helpful to organize and plan out my code on a conceptual
                            level before writing it out. I realized sometimes it’s okay to quit while you’re ahead. The
                            menu
                            system was already working, so I could have saved time had I just moved onto the
                            next
                            feature instead of focusing on perfecting this detail. For future projects, I’ll
                            keep
                            in mind the importance of prioritizing the big picture rather than getting stuck on one
                            small
                            aspect.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            In retrospect, I realized the importance of planning ahead, especially when it came to
                            piecing
                            together the final box. A lot of last minute problems arose which I definitely did not
                            anticipate, for instance the internal pieces being too tightly fitted inside. If I had
                            measured
                            more thoughtfully ahead of time, I might have made the box bigger. In addition, the buttons
                            at
                            the top did not have ample support below. I applied some creative problem solving and taped
                            wood
                            pieces below them for base support. Next time, I know to work on my project earlier to give
                            myself ample time to make these mistakes, or better yet, have time to plan ahead and
                            anticipate
