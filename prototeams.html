                    <p>Forming teams is often challenging. There are many factors to consider when selecting team
                        members: personality, skills, etc. But which ones really matter?
                        As a tool to facilitate face-to-face, small group interactions, ProtoTeams eases the process of
                        finding teams by helping you meet with potential members and "prototype" teams before choosing
                        members you want to work with.

                    ProtoTeams is a system designed to help people meet potential
                    teammates through a series of short, small group activities.
                    Based on the concept of "speed dating", this app allows people to
                    interact with various temporary groups, before committing to a long-term team.

                <h3>How It Works</h3>
                <p>
                    ProtoTeams is divided into 3 components: a participant mobile interface,
                    a shared display, and a host dashboard. The shared display is displayed or projected
                    on a large screen and is controlled by the host. Each session has a certain number of rounds, each
                    containing a number of activities, Sessions can be customized (group size, number of rounds, types
                    of
                    activities) by the host through the dashboard.
