                    <p>Our project looks into the potential to reframe personal informatics as professional informatics
                        (ProI). Building off the ClassInsight project, a ProI dashboard for classrooms, I conducted an
                        interview study on a wider set of professional user groups (outside of just teachers) to confirm
                        whether there is a need for this technology and consider how best to design towards their needs.

                <h3>Context</h3>
                <p>
                    Personal informatics are systems that collect and visualize personal data to help users reflect on
                    their own behavior and set goals to improve. Popular examples include Fitbit, Apple Watch, etc.
                    Our project looks into personal informatics for the workplace, ProI.</p>
                <p>

                    Prior research on ProI has only focused on singular case studies. ex: Automated measures of session
                    quality for medical students or psychotherapists. However, we aimed to examine the broader
                    implications of the concept of ProI, studying generalizations across different professions.

                <h3>Goal: Is ProI useful/worth developing?</h3> <br />

                As a first step towards answering this larger question, our study focused on the following research
                questions about ProI: <br /> <br />
                <ol>

                    <li>Can certain aspects be generalized across professions?</li>
                    <li>What data is useful to collect?</li>
                    <li>What are the opportunities and barriers?</li>

                    <div class="side-descrip">
                        I researched professions that met the following criteria: <br /><br />
                        <ul>
                            <li>Instrumented Space: workplaces with increasing amounts of technology being integrated

                        I decided on the following target groups: <b>therapists, nurses, and police.</b>

                        I conducted semi-structured qualitative interviews to gain in-depth perspective into target
                        groups’ responses to ProI. The goal of the interview was to understand professionals’ responses
                        to ProI. Questions prompted them on what data they would like to see about themselves, and
                        whether they saw a need for this technology within their own profession, and what privacy
                        concerns about the system they had.
                        The interviews were 30 min long and remotely conducted over the video-conferencing platform
                        Zoom.

                        One of the biggest challenges during this project was the recruiting process. Emails to contacts
                        were sent out throught a google script which helped speed up the process through automation.
                        Snowball sampling also proved very effective, as one participant could often help refer the
                        study information along to other professionals within their network.

                <p>Many saw ProI as a training opportunity for less experienced professionals
                    Would allow beginners to gain efficiencies, measure and make progress through objective goal-setting
                    Ex: Therapists review sessions with supervisor/peers in practicum setting, ProI could provide
                    another data point for discussion
                    Professionals were interested in their influence on others’ behavior
                    Wanted to see whether their intuition matched the actual way they are perceived
                    Objective way to reflect on the quality of client interactions
                    A high area of interest was biometrics, stress-tracking
                    Track times of the day/context in which they are stressed → develop interventions to improve their
                    wellness
                    Nurses and police both expressed they work in high stress environment
                    Privacy concerns about data collection
                    Privacy concerns depend on the nature of the work (public/private)
                    Ex: Police work in the public sector, already monitored via body cams, so view this device as less
                    intrusive to their work compared to therapists who work in a more sensitive, private environment
                    Nurses and therapists stressed importance of required client consent

                <p>Through this interview study, we were able to find generalizations across different professions’
                    responses to ProI and gain a better understanding of user needs. Our research hopefully provides a
                    basis for design guidelines for the development of future ProI technology.</p>

                    include further exploring the insights from this study (conditions for usefulness, how to mitigate
                    privacy concerns, implementing a prototype), as well as examining opportunities for ProI in other
                    professions outside the three our study narrowed down on.
